            <p>In 1984, GEMS School was established in Sanepa, Lalitpur with 78 students and 25 staff members. Initially, it offered classes from Nursery to grade III, but it has now grown into a higher secondary school with classes from grade one to twelve. The school recently completed construction on its own school complex in Dhapakhel, which is 1.5 kilometers away from Sato Dobato point on the Ring road. In August 2000, the school shifted all classes from Kiran Bhawan in Sanepa to the new complex, accommodating classes from four to ten. From 2077, the school started running classes from one to ten in the new complex.</p>
